Model
---
* Get graph data back into tensorboad
* Performance and size
  * v2 model more than doubled in VRAM and is waaaay slower - 168s/epoch instead of 64s/epoch
* Multi-GPU
* Utility to rename files with their hash
* Bust the testset into jpgs
* Figure out this NaN problem
  * Suspect gradient explosion, try gradient clipping?
  * Can I load a broken checkpoint and find the source?
* Full TF2 validation training
* Refactor to tf.Loss? (do I need multiples?)
* Huggingface compatibility
* Profiling
* High rez training
* Stability

GUI
---
* Soft-start
  * Scale the fps up/dn subtley to adjust the position without skipping the initial frames
* Instant mix-in
* gallery of seed images with mixin controls
* Some sort of bugs with buffer size getting out of sync and stuff
* Split into GUI w/ model in separate python module repo

WARNING:tensorflow:5 out of the last 5 calls to <function _BaseOptimizer._update_step_xla at 0x7f964062ea70> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors.

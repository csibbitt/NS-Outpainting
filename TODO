Model
---
* Faster startup for testing (limit dataset load)
* Eliminate @tf.compat.v1.keras.utils.track_tf1_style_variables
* Eliminate get_or_create_layer
* Replace leaky-relu with tf
* Refactor layout of models vs layers vs utilities
* Upgrade best training checkpoint to V2 Model saves
* Refactor to tf.Loss (do I need multiples?)
* Utility to rename files with their hash
* Figure out this NaN problem
  * Can I load a broken checkpoint and find the source?
* Finish migration to full TF V2
* Full TF2 validation training
* Huggingface compatibility
* Profiling
* High rez training
* Stability

GUI
---
* Soft-start
  * Scale the fps up/dn subtley to adjust the position without skipping the initial frames
* Instant mix-in
* gallery of seed images with mixin controls
* Some sort of bugs with buffer size getting out of sync and stuff
* Split into GUI w/ model in separate python module repo
